# UA5 XCode iOS Templates

## Instructions

- Clone into `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/`. I know this is fragile (needs to be done on each app update, I think), but it's the only way to override without fussing with new templates and configs.

## Main Changes

- Code style and whitespace.
